    "# Part 3 of \"Exploring GAN latent space to generate images with desired features​ by Digital Sreeni\": Arithmetic with GAN latent vectors (Predict)\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Link to the Youtube tutorial video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuQ_f3W5Ttk&list=PLZsOBAyNTZwboR4_xj-n3K6XBTweC4YVD&index=13\n",

    "\n",
    "3) **Insights of this tutorial:**\n",
    "    1) Latent space is hard to interpret unless conditioned using many classes.​ But, the latent space can be exploited using generated images. Here is how:\n",
    "        1) Generate 10s of images using random latent vectors.​\n",
    "        2) Identify many images within each category of interest (e.g., smiling man, neutral man, etc. )​\n",
    "        3) Average the latent vectors for each category to get a mean representation in the latent space (for that category).​\n",
    "        4) Use these mean latent vectors to generate images with features of interest. ​\n",
    "\n",
    "    2) This part of the code is used to generate 128x128x3 images (of faces) using a trained generator model. \n",
    "    3) Faces can be generated using two random latent vectors and interpolated in between.\n",
    "    4) Finally, the features in the new images can be 'engineered' by doing simple arithmetic between the vectors that are used to generate images. \n",
    "    5) In summary, you can find the latent vectors for Smiling Man, neutral face man, and a baby with neutral face. Then, generate a smiling baby face by:\n",
    "        1) Smiling Man vector + Neutral Man vector - Neutral baby vector = Smiling Baby vector \n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Visual explanation of latent space and how we engineer the features in the new images by doing simple arithmetic between the vectors(points) of the latent space:**\n",
