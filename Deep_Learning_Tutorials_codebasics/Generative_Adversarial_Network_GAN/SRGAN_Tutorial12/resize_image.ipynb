    "# Part 1 of \"Super Resolution GAN (SRGAN) in Keras, Tutorial 12 by DigitalSreeni\": Resize image\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Link to the Youtube tutorial video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HqjPqNglPc&list=PLZsOBAyNTZwboR4_xj-n3K6XBTweC4YVD&index=13\n",
    "2) Link to the MIRFLICKR dataset: http://press.liacs.nl/mirflickr/mirdownload.html\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Instructions:** \n",
    "    1) This is the supplementary script of this tutorial. This script only resizes the images you provide.\n",
    "    2) Run this script to resize each original (real high resolution) image into its corresponding low resolution image of size S_low and fake high resolution image of size S_high.\n",
    "    3) Use the virtual environment called GPUEnv to run this script. This virtual environemnt uses Python 3.7.16 version, Tensorflow 2.6.0 version, Keras 2.6.0 version.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Motivation**:\n",
    "    1) In this tutorial, we will use a SRGAN to take each low resolution image to generate its corresponding fake high resolution image.\n",
    "    2) To train the SRGAN for this task, we need:\n",
    "        1) Real and fake high resolution images to calculate the content loss (involving generator and VGG)\n",
    "        2) Low resolution images and its corresponding real high resolution images to calculate the adversarial loss (involving generator and discriminator)\n",
    "    3) Our dataset consists of images with different sizes but the VGG and SRGAN accept images only in a specific size. Hence, we need to do image processing to resize our original images in the dataset.\n",
    "    4) We get:\n",
    "        1) Real high resolution image: by taking each original image in the dataset and resize it into the shape we want for a high resolution shape, S_high\n",
    "        2) Low resolution image: by taking each image already resized into S_high and further resize it into the shape we want for a low resolution shape, S_low\n",
    "        3) where S_high > S_low.\n",
    "    5) When we resize an image into a smaller size, the image will loss some information (a portion of pixel values are removed and not retrievable in future). This happens when we resize an image into S_high or S_low size.\n",
    "    6) However, when we take that image in the S_low size and enlarge it back into S_high size, this image will appear as pixelated (more pixel values are newly generated based on averaging method) compared to the same image that is resized into S_high.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) In this tutorial, we define:\n",
    "    1) Shape of high resolution image, S_high: 128x128 pixels\n",
    "    2) Shape of high resolution image, S_low: 32x32 pixels"
