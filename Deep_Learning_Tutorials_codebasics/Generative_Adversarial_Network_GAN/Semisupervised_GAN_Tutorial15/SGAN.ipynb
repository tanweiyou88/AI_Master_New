    "2) **Explanation of SGAN:**\n",
    "    1) The purpose of semi-supervised GAN (SGAN) is to get a trained discriminator (it is the trained discriminator) that can perform classification tasks well similar to CNN, even with a small labelled dataset.\n",
    "    2) Supervised part:\n",
    "        1) When the discriminator is trained with ground truths of dataset class labels, the discriminator is trained to learn the image features of different classes in the dataset.\n",
    "    3) Unsupervised part:\n",
    "        1) When the discriminator is trained with ground truths of if the given image is real/fake, the discriminator is trained to learn the image features of the dataset, such that it can take an image and tell if that image looks similar to the ones in that dataset (based on the features of that image). If that image looks similar to that dataset, the discriminator will provide probability score >= 0.5 (indicating it is a real image). Else, the discriminator will provide probability score < 0.5 (indicating it is a fake image)\n",
    "        2) The generator is trained to generate each image that consists of features similar to the ones in that dataset, so that the generator can fool the discriminator to classify the generated image is a real image (an image looks similar to the ones in that dataset used to train the discriminator)\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Explanation of why the normal GAN model is an unsupervised learning model:**\n",
    "    1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo1.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "        1) Reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44445778/are-gans-unsupervised-or-supervised\n",
    "    2) For supervised learning model (EG: ANN), we provide data with labels/classes (EG: the class of in MNIST dataset, such as class 0 represents image of number 0) for the ANN to learn to predict a label associated with the data (such that after training with MNIST dataset, the ANN can predict an unseen image 0 to have label of 0, which means the ANN predicts correctly). In other words, the goal of supervised learning is for the model to generalize to new data. Hence, we need to assign labels to the training data (the data comes with labels/classes/categories: supervised).\n",
    "    3) For normal GAN model, we label data with real/fake image ground truths (1/0) [supervised component] for GAN model to learn what the data looks like (EG: in terms of features, density estimation,...) [unsupervised component] so that GAN model can generate new samples of what it has learned [unsupervised component]. However, the data does not comes with class labels that corresponding to its dataset (EG: we do not provide a label 0 to distinguish that data belongs to image of number 0) [unsupervised component]. In other words, we use supervised component to train the GAN model to reach its goal which is the unsupervised component. We define a model as supervised/unsupervised based on the component of its goal. So for the case of GAN model, it is an unsupervised learning model. The most important take away is no labeling (class label of the dataset) is needed or provided to the GAN algorithm.\n",
    "\n",

    "4) **Motivation of having semi-supervised learning:**\n",
    "    1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo2.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    2) It is very hard to annotate(label) a very huge data (EG:MNIST) by you alone\n",
    "    3) Even after you have labelled a very huge data, you don't know if the data you labelled can be used effectively to get good performance (EG: classification results). If can't, you have to relabel the huge data again and this takes lots of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) **Concept of semi-supervised GAN (SGAN):**\n",
    "    1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo3.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "        1) However, if I have lots of data, I would directly use CNN. Because SGAN training is slower compared to regular CNN training, since you're training three models inside the SGAN (supervised discriminator, unsupervised discriminator and generator).\n",
    "    2) <img src=\"hidden\\photo4.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    3) <img src=\"hidden\\photo5.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "        1) Remember that in regular GAN, the discriminator (represented as the discriminator block here) is a binary classifier to classify its input image as real or fake \n",
    "    4) <img src=\"hidden\\photo6.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "        1) But in SGAN, the first part of the discriminator (represented as the discriminator block here) is only a feature extractor. We can extend the functionality of this discriminator by adding a classifier as its second part to make it either a binary classifier discriminator (also called unsupervised discriminator) or multi-class classifier discriminator (also called supervised discriminator). This means both unsupervised and supervised discriminators takes the same extracted features as the input but using their own different classifiers to provide different outputs.\n",
    "        2) The unsupervised discriminator is just a multiclass classifier that classify(predict) the dataset class label of the input data(image).\n",
    "        3) The supervised discriminator is just a binary classifier that classify(predict) if the input data(image) is a real data(image) [something like if the input data(image) looks similar to the ones in that dataset used for training]. \n",
    "    5) <img src=\"hidden\\photo7.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    6) Generator structure:\n",
    "        1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo8.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    7) Supervised discriminator structure:\n",
    "        1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo9.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    8) Unsupervised discriminator structure:\n",
    "        1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo10.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    9) Composite model structure (generator + unsupervised discriminator):\n",
    "        1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo11.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    10) SGAN training process:\n",
    "        1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo12.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "        2) Eventually, we will only take the trained supervised discriminator to perform classification tasks. According to the SGAN training process, it can be understood in this way:\n",
    "            1) The weights and parameters of the first part of supervised discriminator [feature extractor] and also the second part of the supervised discriminator [multiclass classifier] are updated (trained) based on the loss function obtained when the supervised discriminator is trained using labelled data\n",
    "            2) The weights and parameters of the first part of supervised discriminator [feature extractor] are updated (trained) based on the loss function obtained when the unsupervised discriminator is trained using unlabelled real and fake data. This is because both the supervised and unsupervised discriminators share/use/consists the same feature extractor (first part of discriminator).\n",
    "            3) The generator plays the role of generating fake data to train the weights and paramters of the first of the first part of supervised discriminator [feature extractor]. The weights and parameters of the generator are updated (trained) based on the loss function obtained when the composite model is trained, so that the generator can generate better fake data to train the weights and parameters of the first part of supervised discriminator [feature extractor] better from time to time.\n",
    "\n",

    "6) **Goal of this tutorial:**\n",
    "    1) When small labelled data (EG: total 100 labelled MNIST images, 10 images for each class) are used to trained a CNN for classification tasks, the CNN yields test accuracy of 79%. By using the same labelled data, can a semi-supervised GAN (SGAN) can be trained for classification tasks and yield test accuracy higher than the one of CNN?"
