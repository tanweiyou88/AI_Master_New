    "# Simple Explanation of Convolutional Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "0) neural network in machine learning means artificial neural network (ANN), which is a fully connected dense neural network consisting an input layer and output layer (optional to have hidden layer) to perform classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Possible image variety:  <br />\n",
    "    <img src=\"hidden\\photo1.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    <img src=\"hidden\\photo2.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    <img src=\"hidden\\photo3.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    <img src=\"hidden\\photo4.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Number of layers affect computation complexity:  <br />\n",
    "    1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo5.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    2) EG: This koala image has image size of 1920 x 1080 x 3 (means width 1920, heigth 1080, and 3 colour channels [RGB]). This means this image has 1920 x 1080 x 3 = 6 millions features.\n",
    "    3) The input layer of the ANN to classify this image must have 1920 x 1080 x 3 = 6 millions input neurons/units.\n",
    "    4) Let's say you have a hidden layer with 4 millions neurons, the total number of weights (parameters) between the input and hidden layers equals 6 millions x 4 millions = 24 milllions, which is too much computation for computer (computation is complex). [because in ANN, each neuron in  input layer is connected to all neurons in the consecutive hidden layer. If input layer only consists 1 input neuron while the hidden layer consists of 4 millions neurons, it means the total number of weights (parameters) between the input and hidden layers equals 1 x 4 millions = 4 millions] \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Disadvantages of using ANN for image classification: <br />\n",
    "    1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo6.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    2) For 2 & 3, it means when the same image but with the object location in the image shifted, ANN will have difficulty in classify the object although ANN has been trained to classify the object. \n",
    "\n",
    "4) Theoretically, the reasons why human can recognize any image easily: <br />\n",
    "    1) Human look at the little features of the object\n",
    "    2) <img src=\"hidden\\photo7.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    3) <img src=\"hidden\\photo8.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "\n",
    "5) How to make computers to recognize the tiny features of the object in an image: <br />\n",
    "    1) Use the concept of filter. Each filter responsible to detect different tiny features using convolution operation. After convolution operation using a 2D filter, a corresponding feature map will be generated.\n",
    "        1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo9.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "        2) <img src=\"hidden\\photo10.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    2) On a feature map, whenever you see number 1 or a number close to 1, it means the tiny feature you want is detected on this image (feature is activated).\n",
    "        1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo11.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "        2) <img src=\"hidden\\photo12.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    3) In summary, when you apply a filter to perform convolution operation, you are generating a feature map that has that particular feature detected.\n",
    "        1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo13.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    4) Extract tiny feature using a filter with convolution operation realizes location invariant (EG: the filter can detect eyes in any location of the image)\n",
    "        1) For this example, if the eyes are at a different locations, it will still detect because you are moving the filter throughout the image and they are location invariant which means doesn't matter where the eyes are in the image these filters will detect those eyes and it will activate those particular regions.\n",
    "            1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo14.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    5) The feature maps will stack together to form a kind of 3D volume\n",
    "        1) EG: I apply three filters i got three feature maps and this is how these feature maps are represented if you're reading any online article or a book they are kind of stacked together and they almost form a 3d volume\n",
    "            1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo15.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "            2) <img src=\"hidden\\photo16.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    6) After multiple feature maps are stacked together, we apply a 3D filter to extract a more general feature from the stacked feature map, by producing a new 2D feature map.\n",
    "        1) EG: Extract the head feature (a more general feature) from the features of eyes, nose & ears (tiny features).\n",
    "        1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo17.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "            1) EG: Just imagine the first dimension of the stacked feature maps is representing eyes and the second slice is representing nose and third slice representing ears.\n",
    "            2) And by doing that 3D filter you can say that koala's head is in this particular region of an image\n",
    "            3) So you are aggregating these results using the 3D filter for head and now this becomes a koala head detector\n",
    "    7) After obtaining the feature maps of more general features, flatten them into 1D array and then feed them to ANN as the input to perform classsification task.\n",
    "        1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo18.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "            1) Here, now we got these two new feature maps where the upper feature map is saying that koala's head is at this location and the bottom feature map is saying the paula's body is at this particular location. Then, we flatten these feature maps by converting each of them from 2D array into 1D array. And then when you get these two 1D array, just join (concatenate) them together to create a new 1D array. After you concatenate them, you provide the newly created 1D array as the input for the ANN (fully connected dense neural network) to perform classification task.\n",
    "        2) For different images, when the feature location is different, different flatten 1D arrays will be generated. Then, ANN is used to handle the variety in your inputs such that it can classify those variety of inputs in a generic way.\n",
    "    8) CNN consists of 2 parts:\n",
    "        1) First part: Convolution operations for feature extractions (means detecting features)\n",
    "        2) Second part: ANN for classification\n",
    "            1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo19.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    9) We apply ReLU activation function right after a feature map to bring non-linearity in our model. \n",
    "        1) ReLU activation function will take your feature map and whatever negative values are there, it just replaces that with zero. If the value is more than zero, it will keep it as it is\n",
    "        2) <img src=\"hidden\\photo20.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "        3) <img src=\"hidden\\photo21.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    10) We apply pooling right after the ReLU activation function of a feature map to reduce dimension of the feature map.\n",
    "        1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo22.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "        2) Max pooling (more generally used):\n",
    "            1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo23.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "            2) <img src=\"hidden\\photo24.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "                1) pooling along with convolution helps you with position invariant feature detection (means although the target feature is shifted in the image, the convolution + pooling still can detect the shifted feature)\n",
    "        3) Average pooling:\n",
    "            1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo25.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "        4) <img src=\"hidden\\photo26.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "            1) For Benefit 3: Because if there is a distortion and if you're picking just a maximum number you are capturing the main feature and you are filtering all the noise\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Summary of the complete convolutional neural network (CNN):\n",
    "    1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo27.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "        1) You will have typically a convolution layer and ReLU layer, then you will have a pooling layer. Then, there will be another convolution ReLU, and pooling layers. There could be n number of layers for convolution, ReLU and pooling. And in the end, you will have fully connected dense neural network.\n",
    "        2) You will start with extracting/detecting the tiny features (EG: little edges), then you go to extract more general features (EG: eye, nose, ears). Then, you go to extract more more general features (EG:head and body), and then you do flattening again.\n",
    "        3) The main idea behind convolutional neural network is feature extraction because the second part is a simple artificial neural network. But by doing this convolution, you are detecting the features & reducing the dimension\n",
    "        4) You will specify a hyperparameter of how many filters you want to have in your CNN and what is the size of each of the filters. That's it but you do not specify the exact values (pixel weightages) within these filters, the network will learn those on its own. \n",
    "    2) Benefit of convolution, ReLU & pooling layer:  <br />\n",
    "        1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo28.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "    3) Drawback of CNN:  <br />\n",
    "        1) <img src=\"hidden\\photo29.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br />\n",
    "        2) <img src=\"hidden\\photo30.png\" alt=\"This image is a representation of the simple neural network\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>  <br /> \n",
    "            1) Scale = Thickness\n",
    "    4) What is data augmentation:\n",
    "        1) Let's say for handwritten digits, you take your original dataset and then you pick few samples. And then you rotate them manually or you make them larger or smaller, thicker or thinner, and then you generate new samples. \n",
    "        2) By doing that, you can handle rotation and scale in convolutional neural network.\n",
